# Machine Learning for Log Processing

## Description
* With ever increasing number of programming languages, frameworks, back-end and middle-ware products, servers, software-as-a-service, geo-collocation, and public cloud offerings logging into servers to check log files or even aggregating logs into a central location does not seem to be enough for effective troubleshooting and alerting practices
* Things are about to get worse: with the burgeoning Internet of Things promising to connect billions of new devices and their data streams, it's a sure bet we'll have far more components to troubleshot and logging data to process
* Software vendors and public cloud providers are rushing to the market place with Machine Learning offerings to automate and to streamline data processing in autonomous or semi-autonomous fashion
